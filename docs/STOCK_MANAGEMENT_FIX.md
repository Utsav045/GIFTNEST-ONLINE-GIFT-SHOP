# Stock Management Fix - IntegrityError Resolution

## Issue Description
The error "CHECK constraint failed: stock" occurred when users tried to create orders that would reduce product stock below zero. This violated the `PositiveIntegerField` constraint on the `Product.stock` field.

## Root Cause
In `orders/views.py`, the order creation process was reducing product stock without checking if sufficient stock was available:

```python
# Original problematic code
product = item['product']
product.stock -= item['quantity']  # Could result in negative stock
product.save()
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stock Validation Before Order Creation
- Added pre-validation to check stock availability for all cart items
- Display clear error messages when insufficient stock is detected
- Prevent order creation if any item exceeds available stock

### 2. Atomic Transaction Management  
- Wrapped order creation in `transaction.atomic()` to ensure data consistency
- If any part of the order creation fails, all changes are rolled back

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Added message display to the order create template
- Updated cart template to show real-time stock information
- Added stock availability badges (In Stock, Limited Stock, Out of Stock)
- Improved quantity controls with proper stock limits

### 4. Code Changes

#### `orders/views.py`
```python
@login_required
def order_create(request):
    cart = Cart(request)
    if len(cart) == 0:
        return redirect('cart:cart_detail')
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # First, check stock availability for all items
        stock_errors = []
        for item in cart:
            product = item['product']
            if product.stock < item['quantity']:
                stock_errors.append(f"{product.name}: Only {product.stock} items available, but {item['quantity']} requested")
        
        if stock_errors:
            for error in stock_errors:
                messages.error(request, error)
            return render(request, 'orders/create.html', {'cart': cart})
        
        # Use transaction to ensure atomicity
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                order = Order.objects.create(...)
                for item in cart:
                    OrderItem.objects.create(...)
                    # Reduce stock safely (already validated)
                    product = item['product']
                    product.stock -= item['quantity']
                    product.save()
                cart.clear()
                messages.success(request, 'Order created successfully!')
                return redirect('payment:process', order_id=order.id)
        except Exception as e:
            messages.error(request, f'An error occurred while creating the order: {str(e)}')
            return render(request, 'orders/create.html', {'cart': cart})
```

#### `templates/orders/create.html`
- Added message display section to show stock errors to users

#### `templates/cart/detail.html`
- Added real-time stock information with color-coded badges
- Enhanced quantity controls with proper stock limits
- Improved user awareness of stock availability

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents negative stock values that violate database constraints
2. **User Experience**: Clear feedback when stock is insufficient
3. **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations ensure data consistency
4. **Proactive Prevention**: Users see stock information before checkout
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of any unexpected errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test order creation with sufficient stock
2. Test order creation with insufficient stock
3. Test multiple users trying to order the same limited stock item
4. Test cart updates when stock changes
5. Verify message display functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time stock updates using WebSockets
2. Stock reservation during checkout process  
3. Inventory management dashboard for admins
4. Low stock alerts for administrators
5. Automatic stock reordering system

This fix ensures robust stock management and prevents the IntegrityError while providing better user experience.
